The `backend /` directory contains a local server based on the express.js solution which sets up a local API to be used within the application.

## How to run:

Before starting it for the first time, in the `backend /` directory, 
run the command `yarn`, which will take all the necessary dependencies.

Each time you fire up with the command `yarn start`, 
the API will be exposed at` http: //0.0.0.0: 3000`. :)
